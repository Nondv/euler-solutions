# euler-solutions

So I managed to lose all of my solutions (in multiple languages!!!) by acciidentally deleting the .org file containing them.

Time to keep everything under git.


I'm leaving it public but I do hope you won't use it for cheating. The problems are worth solving on your own.
The reason for leaving it public is that maybe someone would want to check it out when I'm applying for a job or something.
